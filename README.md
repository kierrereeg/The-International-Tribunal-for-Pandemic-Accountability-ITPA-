The International Tribunal for Pandemic Accountability (ITPA) - Overview & Mission

In the wake of the unprecedented global crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of lives have been lost, economies shattered, and countless individuals have suffered immeasurable pain and loss. As we collectively strive to rebuild and recover from the devastation, it has become increasingly evident that there is an urgent need to address the myriad of concerns, questions, and potential wrongdoings that have arisen during this period of turmoil.

"The International Tribunal for Pandemic Accountability (ITPA)" is a proposal, a call to action, and a declaration that now is the time to come together to demand accountability, transparency, and justice. This document serves as the starting point for a framework, an idea, and a Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) designed to mobilize the collective will and determination of people from all corners of the world. The ITPA is a clarion call for all those who have been touched by the pandemic, who have witnessed the depths of loss and the countless horror stories, and who have recognized the inconsistencies, contradictions, and potential malfeasance in the response to this global emergency. 
As we embark on this journey towards accountability and justice, we acknowledge that this document is merely the beginning. It is a foundation upon which we will build and refine our collective efforts, with the understanding that the ITPA DAO will grow and change over time as more people join our cause and contribute their ideas and perspectives. We must remember that this is not a task that can be accomplished by a single individual, organization, or nation. It is a collective effort that requires the support, determination, and resilience of people across the globe.

Together, we must push our representatives, create organizations, establish online groups, and take any and all steps necessary to move this initiative forward. We must channel our pain, our anger, and our hope into a cohesive, organized movement that will ensure that the lessons of the pandemic are learned, and that those who have failed in their duty to protect and serve are held accountable for their actions.

With the Discord server as one of the main hubs for the ITPA DAO, we present a detailed and comprehensive plan for the establishment of the International Tribunal for Pandemic Accountability. As you engage with the community and explore the proposal, we invite you to join us in this fight for justice, transparency, and accountability. Our task may be monumental, but our determination is unwavering, and our cause is just. United in our efforts, we can make the ITPA DAO a reality and ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated, and that the legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic serves as a powerful reminder of our collective responsibility to protect and care for one another.
This is our moment to stand up, to come together, and to create a better future. We call on each and every one of you to heed this call, to join us in this noble endeavor, and to contribute to the growth and evolution of the International Tribunal for Pandemic Accountability DAO. Together, we will forge a new path towards a world that is more just, more accountable, and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead. Let us transform our collective grief into a driving force for change, and let the ITPA DAO be a living testament to the power of the human spirit and the unbreakable bonds that connect us all.
